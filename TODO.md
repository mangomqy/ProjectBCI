# TODO:

1. Make Reference Siganl class a module, outside the main application.
2. Error handling, god damn it!
3. Little refactor in the future...?
4. Better process managing. (Eror after trail is done should be removed.)
5. Classifier inside application should be better.
6. CCA class should be a module.
7. All other TODOs inside application ;)
8. Warm up & key control managing
9. Project tree (directories)
10. Calibration module, which configure application to maximize SSVEP correlation during trial, and minimalize signal noise.
